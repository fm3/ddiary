• pdf report from data: stats about average bgs, food, insulin, injections, time above/below target
• graph: display time-action profile for entered insulin?
• graph: show KE-factors used?
• graph: fingersticks: show red circle at according y
• make guesses about the future?
• python: back up log entries from phone
• refactor js: separate wizard widgets
• properly support different screen sizes


✓ draw logarithmic value graph
✓ display log entries on correct time
✓ double click opens wizard
✓ drag number input
✓ input flags +≈↑L
✓ display flags
✓ go to previous days, display day
✓ a vertical „now“ line
✓ draw coordinate system
✓ VBS-script to automate libre software CSV data export
✓ on save success, clear updatedDays
✓ time widget: show how long ago
✓ suggest insulin dose, define KE factors in settings
✓ second wizard page to add fingersticks and notes
✓ graph: display note log entries
✓ update nowline when app gets focus
✓ suggestion should belong to the left page
✓ don’t show suggestion when value is 0
✓ graph: display fingersticks
✓ graph: draw log entries directly above graph (insulin) and below (food)
✓ graph: prevent log entry textnode collisions
✓ refactoring: split css file
✓ sort log entries by date in json (fixed by generating ids in HHMMSSrrrr format)
✓ add only true flags to log entry objects?
✓ show gaps in graph if there are gaps in the bg data
✓ wizard: checking »+« in carbs should also check fast-acting
✓ python: find a non-popupping way of querying if the phone is connected
✓ day navigation buttons custom css (so the inactive one doesn’t change size while pressed)
✓ refactor: double quotes in all string literals
✓ refactor: screenConsole init from js, separate js file
✓ screenConsole automatic clear after 10s
✓ refactor: check semicolon line endings
✓ refactor: check for loops (forEach in arrays, hasOwnProperty-check in objects)
✓ interaction to delete already saved log entries
✓ support adding log entries to the previous day
✓ why and when is the now line jumping around? after lockscreen: portrait mode → wrong x
✓ python: handle big clock corrections as timezone changes
✓ reload bgs when usb is disconnected (listen to battery chargingchange)
✓ check name consistency, rename “event” to “logEntry”
✓ python: create phone bg dir if it’s missing (first run)
✓ VBS: csv export directory should be parameter passed from python
✓ onFocus after night, switch to new day if current day was shown
✓ refactor: days and util should be in closure (except $(id))
✓ write readme
